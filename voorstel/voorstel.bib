  abstract    = {We developed an algorithm that tracks the movements of ten different players from a video of a basketball game. With their position tracked, we then proceed to map the position of these players onto an image of a basketball court. The purpose of tracking player is to provide the maximum amount of information to basketball coaches and organizations, so that they can better design mechanisms of defense and attack. Overall, our model has a high degree of identification and tracking of the players in the court.},
